This is a Choose Your Own Adventure Program. The user will first be given three choices, and each of those choices lead to another two choices. That second decision will lead to one of five endings, with two choices from the second decision block leading to the same ending.

10-18-23: Creation of the program and GitHub repository. The pages and buttons were set up along with most of the story. 10-19-23: The story was completed along with the adding of images and the stylizing of the background, buttons, and font. Finalized.

Peer review: 
<!-- Bria/Max/Christopher- Very calming vibes, organized, buttons were evenly placed and it's consistent through out the whole website/story. Great job on the pictures love that! -->
