    <h3>Started a Fire</h3>
    <p>You didn't want to spend the rest of the night in the dark, so you get some wood thats laying on the beach and start up a fire. It wasn't easy, but you were able to go to sleep with heat and light next to you. In the morning a surfer found you and led you back to civilization.</p>
